 This example demonstrates basic scale output. See the calibration sketch to get the calibration_factor for your
 specific load cell setup.

 This example code uses bogde's excellent library:"https://github.com/bogde/HX711"

 The HX711 does one thing well: read load cells. The breakout board is compatible with any wheat-stone bridge
 based load cell which should allow a user to measure everything from a few grams to tens of tons.
 Arduino pin 2 -> HX711 CLK
 3 -> DAT
 5V -> VCC
 GND -> GND

 The HX711 board can be powered from 2.7V to 5V so the Arduino 5V power should be fine.

}

void loop() {
  // Serial.print("Reading: ");
  Serial.println(abs(scale.get_units())/22.0462); //we divide by 22.0462 as the physical load cell is rated for 10 kg of force detection- allows us to output a precentage directly to python
  // Serial.print(" lbs"); //You can change this to kg but you'll need to refactor the calibration_factor
  //Serial.println();
